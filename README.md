# Ethereum Multi-Sig Wallet

This project is a prototype for a Multi-Sig Wallet implementation in Solidity. The aim was to learn how to create and use Ethereum smart contracts from start to finish.

## Goals achieved

- [x] Replicated a non-trivial smart-contract. [Source](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/multi-sig-wallet/)

- [x] Wrote unit tests for the smart-contract using Chai

- [x] Learned how to use the Ethereum JSON-RPC API

- [x] Learned how to use Ethers.js

- [x] Improved TypeScript skills by creating types for all the smart-contract types and methods. This made development much easier.

- [x] Deployed the contract to a local network using hardhat

- [x] Deployed the contract to the Ropsten Testnet using [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com)

- [x] Created an UI to interact with the contract

- [x] The UI responds to events, instantly updating any relevant data

- [x] All the contract methods worked as expected

The UI lacks error handling and the code requires extensive refactoring.

I wanted to make the UI look better and refactor the code, but since I have plenty of experience with front-end development, I decided to move on and learn more Solidity.
